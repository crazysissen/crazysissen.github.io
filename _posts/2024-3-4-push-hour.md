A fun speedrunning game about shoving commuters onto the subway.

*Push Hour* is our **prize-winning** submission to SpeedJam 4. For the game, we won the *streamer's choice award*, becoming one of three winning games for the first section of the 72-hour game jam!

The first game made as part of the the KONGSTRONK project: a game development duo made up of myself and a close friend of mine. The goal of these jams has always been a three-way split: grow as game developers, finish more games, and have fun. While I've been making games for many years, putting the pressure on each other really helps bring out my enthusiasm for game development.

If you're on desktop, you can try out the game right in your web browser by following the link below!

Push Hour was developed from scratch in 72 hours using the Unity game engine. We both have lots of prior experience using Unity, and for this game I acted as lead programmer. Trying out new techniques and features to distinguish the game, we decided to build a core part of the game on *simulated crowd dynamics*. Commuters are individual agents and all move with respect to each other. The entire game exists within a one-scene environment, with individual games stopping and starting smoothly without transitions and loading screens: the player gets thrown right into the action.
