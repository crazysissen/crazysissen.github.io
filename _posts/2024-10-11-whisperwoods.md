A **video game** and **engine** built from scratch in six weeks as a university group project 

<!--more-->

Representing the culmination of our first three years in university, Whisperwoods shows off many facets of video game tech, rendering, creative optimization, and software engineering. Developed with little integration of external software libraries, the game features a renderer built from scratch using DirectX 11, custom resource asset formats, procedural world generation, and fast-paced strategic stealth gameplay, all optimized to run smoothly on very rudimentary hardware.

The team, consisting of six developers specialized and interested in different things, synergized to build a fairly well-rounded game engine. The software features and gameplay overview are demonstrated in an early build trailer available on YouTube.

Of course, I was not the totality of the development group. These are my contributions:
- Initial rendering and lighting
- Render pass optimizations and mass instancing
- Program infrastructure and core system design
- Codebase maintenance and refactoring
- Procedural world generation
- Contributions to core software architecture
- Build system configuration and build automation
- Music and iconography
