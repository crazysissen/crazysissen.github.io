<h2 id="tool">TOOL</h2>

<p>The <em>Tired-Of-Objects Library</em>, or <em>TOOL</em>, is a constantly evolving multi-platform function-oriented standard library built for performance, simplicity, and flexibility. The library was born out of dissatisfaction with much of modern object-oriented design, along with the massive C++ standard libraries that follow. From these feelings spring a desire for something better, and more suited to my needs and the needs of my peers.</p>

<p>Headers are intentionally built <strong>short</strong>, <strong>simple</strong>, and <strong>straight-forward</strong>. This works in a low-level software developerâ€™s favor for a number of reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It cuts down the horrendous compile times often experienced with the humongous templated C++ standard library includes to near-zero. Wanting a translation unit to act on a string of text should not require an extra second on every compile.</li>
  <li>It simplifies error logging, as functionality is more specific and less templated. The smallest perceivable error in a call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::format</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">std::regex_search</code> can produce a short novel for you to read through, a waste of time if there ever was one.</li>
  <li>It self-documents the functionality through a legible and digestible interface. Following a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#include &lt;string&gt;</code> link to the source file seldom provides enlightenment on anything. Well-designed code can benefit from, but should not <em>require</em>, extensive commenting or documentation to be comprehensible.</li>
  <li>It breaks down the humongous array of esoteric utilities made available through large modern standard libraries into the most core constituent parts. Performance-oriented programmers strive to optimize their software and understand its workings, not pray to higher powers that the standard library becomes the bottleneck.</li>
